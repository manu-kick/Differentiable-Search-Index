This repository contains the code and the report for the course project of "Deep Learning" held by Prof. Fabrizio Silvestri at Sapienza, University of Rome.

You will also find my handmade theory cheatsheet for the course in the "cheatsheet" folder. This contains the highlights of the course and is a good resource for exam preparation, it is inspired by prof. Silvestri's slides and some resources found online.

The code is really self explanatory, while the report actually contains all the details regarding the project.

There is also the presentation that we used for the final exam, it is a good summary of the report and the project.

This project has been developed in collaboration with [Gianmarco Scarano].
